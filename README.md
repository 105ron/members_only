# Members Only

A sample rails app to build authorization and authentication skills. Members only is an exclusive clubhouse where your members can write embarrassing posts about non-members. Inside the clubhouse, members can see who the author of a post is but, outside, they can only see the story and wonder who wrote it.

This is part of [TheOdinProject](http://www.theodinproject.com) Rail's track. See [here](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/authentication?ref=lc-pb) for more information.
